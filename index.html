    <p>
      Hi! I am Harshita Daswani. I am currently learning html and css from
      neogcamp with Tanay Pratap. I am making this Component library as a live
      assignment. This is a component library created by her to better design
      each element. After creating this library she is going to use the
      components in her portfolio, blog and all projects created. This will
      ensure that all her projects have consistent themeing and styling.

      "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is an English-language
      pangramâ€”a sentence that contains all of the letters of the English
      alphabet. Owing to its brevity and coherence, it has become widely known.
      The phrase is commonly used for touch-typing practice, testing typewriters
      and computer keyboards, displaying examples of fonts, and other
      applications involving text where the use of all letters in the alphabet
      is desired.
